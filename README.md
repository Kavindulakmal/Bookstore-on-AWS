# Description
In here I developed a full-stack application(with `CRUD` Operations) and Deployed the app to `Amazon web Service`. I used `Spring boot` for the back-end development and `react` for the Front-end Development. for deploying the app used AWS `RDS` for the database, Two `EC2` instances in two different regions. (`Northern Virginia` and `Tokyo`) and used `ELB` to control traffic. and `S3` Bucket for the storing front-end.
